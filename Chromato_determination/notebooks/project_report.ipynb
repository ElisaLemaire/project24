    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: \n",
    "   - User provides the names of the molecules present in the mixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - The code searches online databases and web pages to gather key physicochemical properties for each molecule:\n",
    "     - **Boiling temperature (°C)**\n",
    "     - **logP (partition coefficient)**\n",
    "     - **pKa (acid dissociation constants)**\n",
    "     - **Molecular mass**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chromatography Type Decision**:\n",
    "   - **Gas Chromatography (GC)**:\n",
    "     - Chosen if the minimum boiling temperature of the compounds is 300°C or higher.\n",
    "   - **Ion Chromatography (IC)**:\n",
    "     - Selected if the maximum molecular mass is less than or equal to 2000, and the maximum logP is negative, with a proposed pH derived from the pKa values.\n",
    "   - **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)**:\n",
    "     - Applied under various conditions depending on logP values and pKa ranges, with different stationary phases and eluent natures suggested based on the specific properties.\n",
    "   - **Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)**:\n",
    "     - Used for compounds with a molecular mass greater than 2000. The eluent nature and exact method depend on the logP values:\n",
    "       - For positive logP values, SEC on gel permeation with an organic solvent is selected.\n",
    "       - Otherwise, SEC on gel filtration with a polyhydroxylated hydrophile polymer in an aqueous solvent is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The code outputs the advisable chromatography type, the nature of the eluent (gas, aqueous, or organic), and the proposed pH for the eluent if applicable."
